# SECTION 1: Calling methods on string or integer objects.
# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
# Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# The include? method is called on the string "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed, include? returns a true false if the word "Hello" is in the string.
# The return value is true
"Hello World".include?("Hello")

# Method .end with is ran on string "Hello World" asking if string ends with ("Hello")
# Returns "false" since Hello is not at the end of string
"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")

# end with? method ran on string Hello World asking if string ends is "rld"
# Returns true becuse rld ends true
"Hello World".end_with?("rld")

# .even? method ran on int 12 checking if its even
# Returns true for 12 being even
12.even?

# .next ran on int 18
# returns 19 because 19 is after 18
18.next

# SECTION 2: Calling methods on variables assigned to strings.
# Declare 2 variables assigned to string objects.
# Call a different built-in Ruby method on each of your variables. 
# https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.0/String.html
# Include comments above each method call explaining the impact and return value of that method.

# EXAMPLE
# The start_with? method is called on the first_name variable, which stores the string object "Jeff". 
# The start_with? method returns true if the data in the first_name variable starts with the argument passed in.
# In this example, the return value is true, because "Jeff" does start with "J".
# The puts command prints the return value of the start_with? method (true) to the console.
first_name = "Jeff"
puts first_name.start_with?("J")

number = 12
puts number.call(2)




# SECTION 3: Calling methods on variables assigned to integers.
# Declare 2 variables assigned to integer objects.
# Call a different built-in Ruby method on each of your variables. 
# https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.0/Integer.html
# Include comments above each method call explaining the impact and return value of that method.



# SECTION 4: Calling methods on variables assigned to arrays.
# Declare 2 variables assigned to arrays.
# Call a different built-in Ruby method on each of your variables. 
# https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.1.0/Array.html
# Include comments above each method call explaining the impact and return value of that method.
